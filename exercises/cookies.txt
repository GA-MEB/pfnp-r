EXPERT TIPS
- Use an ice-cream scoop to form the cookies; level off the dough on the edge of the bowl for perfectly roundness.
- If you didn't think these cookies could get any better, think again! Get creative use with 1/2 cup each of semisweet chocolate chips, peanut butter chips or butterscotch chips instead of the 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips. OMG these are good
