# Next Steps

## References

### HTML

[W3Schools - HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) :
Though iffy for a lot else, their HTML documentation is pretty decent.

### CSS

[W3C Home Page for CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/learning) :
Learn more about CSS as a project.

[MDM - CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) :
The Mozilla Developers' Network has an ok CSS reference.

[W3Schools - CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) :
W3Schools' CSS documentation is actually their best, in my opinion.

### JavaScript

[MDN - JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) :
There's just no subsitute. The MDN has some of the best documentation out
there, and [not just for JavaScript either](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web).

### jQuery

[jQuery.com](http://api.jquery.com/) :
The official jQuery documentation is **really** solid.

### Regular Expressions

[Regular-Expressions.info](http://www.regular-expressions.info/reference.html) :
Pretty decent, but there are a lot of free regex references out there, and
they're all about equally good.

### Node

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/) :
The official docs. Not super-clear at first blush, unfortunately, but they have
a ton of detail.

### PostgreSQL

[Postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/) :
Detailed and reasonably friendly documentation on using Postgres.
